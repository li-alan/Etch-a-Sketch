# Etch-a-Sketch

This webpage is created to replicate an Etch-a-Sketch toy. 
There is currently only very basic functionality.
Simply hover your mouse over the grid of squares and you will begin drawing.
To clear the board, you will have to refresh the page.


You can play with it on this github hosted webpage: https://li-alan.github.io/Etch-a-Sketch/
